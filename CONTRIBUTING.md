## 🔒 Guidelines

1. **Follow rule schemas** - All rules must conform to the defined JSON schemas
2. **Test thoroughly** - Validate rules across different IDEs and scenarios
3. **Document everything** - Provide clear documentation for all new rules
4. **Maintain consistency** - Ensure rules work harmoniously across platforms
5. **Version carefully** - Follow semantic versioning for all changes

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Branching Strategy

- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
  - `feat/` for new rules or features
  - `fix/` for bug fixes or rule corrections
  - `docs/` for documentation updates
  - `chore/` for maintenance tasks
  - `ide/` for IDE-specific implementations

### 2. Making Changes

1. Pull the latest changes from main
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make atomic, focused changes
4. Test your changes across relevant IDEs
5. Validate rule syntax and schemas

### 3. Committing Changes

Follow the Conventional Commits specification with Gitmoji for consistent and meaningful commit messages.

#### Commit Message Format

```
:emoji_code: type(scope): concise description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Commit Types

- `feat`: A new rule or feature
- `fix`: A bug fix or rule correction
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect rule meaning (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A rule change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A change that improves agent performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples

```
:robot: feat(vscode): add typescript formatting rules

- Add consistent TypeScript formatting guidelines
- Configure auto-import organization
- Set up bracket spacing preferences

Closes #123
```

```
:bug: fix(general): correct security rule validation

- Fix regex pattern for password validation
- Update SQL injection prevention rules
- Add missing escape character handling

Closes #456
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Subject Line**
   - Use the imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
   - First letter lowercase
   - No period at the end
   - Keep it under 50 characters

2. **Body**
   - Explain what and why, not how
   - Use bullet points for multiple changes
   - Wrap at 72 characters

3. **Footer**
   - Reference issues with `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
   - Document breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:`
   - Include any relevant migration notes

### 4. Review Process

1. Push your branch and create a merge request
2. Request review from at least one team member
3. Ensure all validation checks pass
4. Address all review comments
5. Test rules in target IDE environments

### 5. Merging Changes

- Squash and merge with a clear, descriptive message
- Delete the feature branch after merge
- Verify all rules validate correctly in main
- Update version number if needed

## 🏆 Best Practices

- **Atomic changes** - Keep changes small and focused on a single improvement
- **Clear documentation** - Document any new or updated rules thoroughly
- **Cross-platform testing** - Test rules across different operating systems and IDEs
- **Performance consideration** - Ensure rules don't significantly impact IDE performance
- **User experience** - Consider how rules affect developer workflow and productivity

## 🔄 Example Workflow

### Adding a New Rule

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/add-logging-standards
   ```

2. Create the rule file following the schema:
   ```bash
   # Edit rules/general/logging-standards.yaml
   ```

3. Add tests and documentation:
   ```bash
   # Create tests/unit/logging-standards.test.js
   # Update docs/RULES.md
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m ":robot: feat(general): add structured logging standards"
   ```

5. Push and create a merge request:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/add-logging-standards
   ```
